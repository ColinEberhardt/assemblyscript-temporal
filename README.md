## assemblyscript-temporal

An implementation of [TC39 Temporal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal) for AssemblyScript, with an focus on non-timezone-aware classes and functionality.

### Why?

AssemblyScript has minimal `Date` support, however, the JS Date API itself is terrible and people tend not to use it that often. As a result libraries like moment / luxon have become staple replacements. However, there is now a [relatively mature TC39 proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal) that adds greatly improved date support to JS. 

### Usage

This library currently supports the following types:

#### `PlainDateTime`

A `PlainDateTime` represents a calendar date and wall-clock time that does not carry time zone information, e.g. December 7th, 1995 at 3:00 PM (in the Gregorian calendar). For detailed documentation see the [TC39 Temporal proposal website](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plaindatetime.html), this implementation follows the specification as closely as possible.

You can create a `PlainDateTime` from individual components, a string or an object literal:

```javascript
datetime = new PlainDateTime(1976, 11, 18, 15, 23, 30, 123, 456, 789);
datetime.year; // 2019;
datetime.month; // 11;
// ...
datetime.nanosecond; // 789;

datetime = PlainDateTime.from("1976-11-18T12:34:56");
datetime.toString(); // "1976-11-18T12:34:56"

datetime = PlainDateTime.from({ year: 1966, month: 3, day: 3 });
datetime.toString(); // "1966-03-03T00:00:00"
```

There are various ways you can manipulate a date:

```javascript
// use 'with' to copy a date but with various property values overriden
datetime = new PlainDateTime(1976, 11, 18, 15, 23, 30, 123, 456, 789);
datetime.with({ year: 2019 }).toString(); // "2019-11-18T15:23:30.123456789"

// use 'add' or 'substract' to add / subtract a duration
datetime = PlainDateTime.from("2020-01-12T15:00");
datetime.add({ months: 1 }).toString(); // "2020-02-12T15:00:00");

// add /  subtract support Duration objects or object literals
datetime.add(new Duration(1)).toString(); // "2021-01-12T15:00:00");
```

You can compare dates and check for equality

```javascript
dt1 = PlainDateTime.from("1976-11-18");
dt2 = PlainDateTime.from("2019-10-29");
PlainDateTime.compare(dt1, dt1); // 0
PlainDateTime.compare(dt1, dt2); // -1
dt1.equals(dt1); // true
```

Currently `PlainDateTime` only supports the ISO 8601 (Gregorian) calendar.

#### `PlainDate`

A `PlainDate` object represents a calendar date that is not associated with a particular time or time zone, e.g. August 24th, 2006. For detailed documentation see the [TC39 Temporal proposal website](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plaindate.html), this implementation follows the specification as closely as possible.

The `PlainDate` API is almost identical to `PlainDateTime`, so see above for API usage examples.

#### `PlainTime`

A `PlainTime` object represents a wall-clock time that is not associated with a particular date or time zone, e.g. 7:39 PM. For detailed documentation see the [TC39 Temporal proposal website](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plaintime.html), this implementation follows the specification as closely as possible.

The `PlainTime` API is almost identical to `PlainDateTime`, so see above for API usage examples.

#### `PlainMonthDay`

A date without a year component. This is useful to express things like "Bastille Day is on the 14th of July".
For detailed documentation see the
[TC39 Temporal proposal website](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plainmonthday.html)
, this implementation follows the specification as closely as possible.

```javascript
const monthDay = PlainMonthDay.from({ month: 7, day: 14 }); // => 07-14
const date = monthDay.toPlainDate({ year: 2030 }); // => 2030-07-14
date.dayOfWeek; // => 7
```

The `PlainMonthDay` API is almost identical to `PlainDateTime`, so see above for more API usage examples.

#### `PlainYearMonth`

A date without a day component. This is useful to express things like "the October 2020 meeting".
For detailed documentation see the
[TC39 Temporal proposal website](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/plainyearmonth.html)
, this implementation follows the specification as closely as possible.

The `PlainYearMonth` API is almost identical to `PlainDateTime`, so see above for API usage examples.

#### `Duration`

A `Duration` represents a duration of time which can be used in date/time arithmetic. For detailed documentation see the
[TC39 Temporal proposal website](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html)

Here's a small example, showing just some of wha you can do with durations:

```javascript
// create a duration
const duration = Duration.from({ days: 1, minutes: 5 });
// add another duration to the first one
const duration2 = duration.add({ days: 2, minutes: 5 })};
duration2.toString(); // "P3DT10M"
```


#### `Now`

The `Now` object has several methods which give information about the current time and date.

```javascript
dateTime = Now.plainDateTimeISO();
dateTime.toString(); // 2021-04-01T12:05:47.357
```
